\label{chapt:nef-extensions}


\section{Challenges Posed by Neuromorphic Hardware}

Some of these are already solved to some extent by standard NEF. Others require more careful consideration / theoretical extensions.

\subsection{Discretization}

\subsection{Quantization}

\subsection{Connectivity}

\subsection{Memory}

Weight factorization on SpiNNaker, Braindrop, and Loihi

\subsection{Spike Traffic}

Amount of internal traffic.

\subsection{External Input-Output}

Amount of external traffic. Also encoding the inputs as spikes, and decoding the outputs.

\subsection{Thermal Variation}

\subsection{Transistor Mismatch}

\subsection{Digital to Analog Conversion}

Pulse-extender

\subsection{Higher-Order Dynamics}

Special case of transistor mismatch


\section{Arbitrary Linear Synapses}

Insert patent here.

\subsection{Linear Transfer Function Characterization}

\subsection{Nonlinear State-Space Characterization}

\subsection{Time-Constant Mismatch}

\subsection{Encoding Filters}

Tactile classification paper

\subsection{Decoding Filter Optimization}
