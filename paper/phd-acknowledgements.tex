This thesis would not have been possible if not for the fruitful interactions with many key figures.
Most notably, my advisor, Chris Eliasmith, who gave me the freedom to swim into the deep end, and the structure, inspiration, counsel, and courage, to ask difficult questions.
Next, comes Terry Stewart, who has been an invaluable source of insight, and knowledge, when it comes to the technical details and intuition behind constructing functional spiking networks using Nengo.
In the early days, Trevor Bekolay, Travis DeWolf, Daniel Rasmussen, and Xuan Choo, all played critical roles in my upbringing, by engaging with my questioning of the Neural Engineering Framework and Nengo.
Also, Eric Hunsberger and Jan Gosmann have both given feedback and provided foundational research that have deeply influenced my work.

Special mention must go out to Kwabena Boahen, who, thoughout every one of our interactions, has indescribably imparted invaluable streams of insight in his critical and uncompromising quest for answers.
Many of his questions have inevitably influenced large portions of this thesis in a positive but subtly pervasive manner.
This extends to memorable moments with many of his students, including Sam Fok, Alex Neckar, and Eric Kauderer-Abrams.

I would also like to recognize the impact of having spoken with Mike Davies from Intel, hearing his characterization of neuromorphic computing, and having his genuine support in getting Loihi into the hands of academics.
Similarly, Wilten Nicola has provided many influential communications regarding higher-order synapses and FORCE learning, while Jamie Knight, Andrew Mundy, and Michael Hopkins have each provided brief but impactful references involving SpiNNaker and high-dimensional sampling.

At an institutional level, I would like to acknowledge the support I've received from
ABR (for Nengo and NengoLib development),
Intel (for access to Loihi),
Femtosense (for access to Braindrop),
and the University of Manchester (for access to SpiNNaker).
Similarly, my acceptance into the neuromorphic workshops of Telluride, Capo Caccia, INRC, and the Nengo Summer School, have all proven to be constructive experiences and motivational fuel.
The Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience~(CTN), Computational Neuroscience Research Group~(CNRG), David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, and the University of Waterloo, have all contributed to providing a supportive academic environment in one way or another.  

The experiments throughout this thesis make extensive use of Python, NumPy, SciPy, Jupyter, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Nengo, and Keras -- for this, we are incredibly grateful to its thousands of contributors.
Repeated mentions are in order for Trevor Bekolay, who provided this \LaTeX{} template and facilitated my contributions to the Nengo software ecosystem.
Likewise, Daniel Rasumussen and Eric Hunsberger, for their help with Nengo development, provisioning of tools, and feedback.

At a personal level, Chris Eliasmith has been an outstanding role model for how to live one's life, in a way that I can only aspire towards.
Jason Batten-Carew has been the source of many extended philisophical discussions centered about the nature of reality and perception, which have undoubtedly rooted their way into my most basic academic pursuits.
I must also thank my Mom and Dad for exciting my curiosity, and enabling my studies, throughout my entire life.
And finally Yang Peng, for providing much-needed perspective and support throughout it all.
