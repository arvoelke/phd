\noindent
Yang Voelker provided the artwork for Figure~\ref{fig:architectures} as well as the brain illustration at the end of this front matter (the winning T-shirt design for the 2018 Telluride Neuromorphic Workshop).
Figure~\ref{fig:touch-network} was designed in collaboration with Ken E. Friedl.
Derivations from Lemma~\ref{lemma:coord-transform}, equation~\ref{eq:pulse-extended-double-exp}, and section~\ref{sec:mismatch}, extend work in collaboration with my co-authors, Kwabena Boahen and Terrence C. Stewart, both of whom provided important steps in accounting for pulse-extended double-exponential synapses with time-constant mismatch.
My advisor, Chris Eliasmith, helped author and edit several publications that have been adapted and extended throughout; references are included at the top of each applicable section.
