This thesis follows standard mathematical conventions of using lower-case italic variables~($u(t)$) to represent scalar quantities, lower-case bold variables~($\V{x}(t)$) to represent vector quantities, upper-case italic variables~($A$) to represent matrices, and Greek letters~($\tau$, $\theta$) to represent quantities with a unit of time.
Bars are included above variables ($\bar{A}$) to indicate discretization in time.
Depending on context, $F(s)$ or $F(z)$ are used to represent complex values in the Laplace $s$-domain, or digital $z$-domain, respectively.
Big~$\bigoh{\cdot}$ notation is used informally to denote the growth rate of functions.

Words cannot tell you how I made the mountains any more than I can drink the ocean with a fork... It would take millions of years, and you would be bored with my description, long before I got through it... because I didn't create the mountains with words, I just did it. Like you open and close your hand. You know how you do this, but can you describe in words how you do it? ... You're conscious, aren't you. Don't you know how you manage to be conscious?''}~\textasciitilde~Alan Watts}}
