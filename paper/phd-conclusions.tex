\section{Contributions}


\section{Future Directions}

Venn diagram showing intersection between biology, hardware, and what is useful?

Make useful: dendritic computation, adaptation.

Encode higher-frequency information.

Encode general temporal features (e.g., extending delay network to other basis functions).

More principled energy-minimizing network construction methods

\subsection{Energy Minimization}

``Differential encoding'' (adaptation)?

Spike-thinning (accumulator on BrainDrop)

Improving scaling by spreading out the spikes (inspired by Den\`eve)

Interneurons on Loihi

Other ideas: attentional routing (inhibition to the source). Dynamically adjusting firing rates from feedback error. Better automated selection of tuning curves (e.g., finding thresholds latent within the decomposition of functions)
